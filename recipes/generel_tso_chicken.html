    <h2>How To Make General Tso Chicken</h2>
    <p>General Tso’s Chicken is a Chinese-American dish of fried chicken pieces that are breaded and tossed in a tangy sauce. This dish is very similar in style to sesame or orange chicken. 
        But, like in much of Chinese food, it’s the sauce that makes each dish unique.

        <h3><strong>Instructions</strong></h3>
        <li>
            Cut chicken into 1-inch cubes. Toss chicken in batches with cornstarch, tapping off the excess. Set dredged chicken on a platter and set aside.
        </li>
        <li>
            In a separate dish, combine all the ingredients for your sauce and whisk to combine.
        </li>
        <li>
            Preheat a non-stick skillet with oil. Cook chicken in 2 to 3 batches, sauteeing until golden on both sides and cooked through then remove the chicken from the pan and transfer to a bowl. 
            Repeat with the remaining chicken, adding more oil as needed. Leave at least 1 Tbsp oil in the pan.
        </li>

        <li>
            Add the garlic, ginger and pepper flakes. Sautee for about 30 seconds or until fragrant.
        </li>

        <li>
            Add the sauce to the skillet and bring it to a simmer while stirring. Let it simmer for 1 minute to cook off the vinegar a little. Taste the sauce and add more soy sauce or rice vinegar to taste if desired. 
            Add the chicken and toss to coat. Serve garnished with sesame seeds if desired.
